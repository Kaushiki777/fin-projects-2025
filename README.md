# Finance Projects – Summer 2025

This repository contains a collection of projects I'm building in Summer 2025 as part of my journey into quantitative finance, trading systems, and financial data analysis. Each project explores a core concept in finance or market structure, implemented using Python and documented for clarity and reproducibility.
